# Google Maps and Places App for Zenefits by David Knight

My app is useful for finding and viewing information about places using google maps and places APIs.

Steps:
1. With the autocomplete search box you can easily enter in a search query..
2. Once you have selected a place you can press enter or click on the search button.
3. The map will automatically reload with place markers matching your input query.
     To make my app easier to use I am using a marker clustering library (MarkerCluster library) that will cluster
     places which overlap.
4. Furthermore, if you would like to know more about a place you can click on a marker and
 a custom info window (InfoBubble library) will pop up. Inside this info window you can view more information about
  the selected place such as the name, address, phone number, rating, picture ,etc.
